Problem Statement:
In Toronto, despite an abundance of housing options, a persistent housing crisis plagues the city. The issue lies not in the scarcity of housing but in the misalignment of resources with the needs of its residents. Take, for instance, the area near Seneca College, where over 50 apartments exist within a 20-mile radius, yet only 35% of students find accommodation there. Meanwhile, families and couples occupy these spaces, commuting long distances to work, also making them unhappy which leads them to search for another space as well.

Imagine a young couple living near Seneca College. While they have a roof over their heads, their daily grind involves juggling work commitments downtown with the demands of family life. The proximity to Seneca College makes little sense for them, yet they reside there due to the scarcity of suitable options elsewhere. While there are apartments available, they may not be designed to accommodate the unique needs of students who require proximity to their educational institution. This mismatch in housing location exacerbates their struggle, leading to constant upheaval as they search for a more conducive living arrangement.

Key Issue:
The heart of the problem lies in the disparity between the demographic needs of a particular area and the occupants therein. Families and professionals coexist in spaces better suited for students, creating an unsettling environment where everyone feels displaced and disconnected from their objective and purpose for that place.

Proposed Solution:
Our solution revolves around the core principle of "Don't reinvent the wheel, just realign it." By harnessing the power of machine learning and data science, we aim to optimize housing allocation and design in Toronto to better serve the needs of its diverse population. We take the establishment and renovation of apartments to the next level by optimizing them for specific purposes, rather than relying on random or automated processes.

Optimization will not be arbitrary; instead, it will be driven by a deep understanding of the demographics data of each locality. For instance, if an apartment is located near a college or schools, we will optimize it with students in mind. Instead of offering generic 2-bedroom apartments with double beds and standard amenities, we will analyze the demand and design the space accordingly. For example, if the apartment is on the 20th floor, we might optimize the 10th floor specifically for students' feasibility. This could involve partitioning the floor into multiple smaller rooms, each equipped with single or bunk beds, rather than keeping a single large space with a living area, TV, and sofa.

Consider the scenario where a student is searching for a room in an apartment near their college. Traditionally, they might be offered a 2-bedroom apartment with a kitchen, washroom, and double beds. However, this setup might not be feasible or practical for the majority of students. By optimizing the space to cater to students' needs, we can create a more suitable living environment. This could involve dividing the rooms further, providing bunk beds or single beds, and potentially making the kitchen smaller to accommodate more bedrooms.

Our approach acknowledges that the demand for housing varies across different demographic groups, and thus, the supply should be tailored accordingly. For students, this might mean prioritizing affordability and space efficiency over luxury amenities. By understanding and addressing the specific needs of each demographic, we aim to make housing more accessible and practical for everyone.

The current disconnect between supply and demand often results in expensive and impractical housing solutions. However, by realigning our approach to housing optimization based on demographic data, we can create spaces that better meet the needs of the population while also being cost-effective and efficient.

Example:
It's just not about students, itâ€™s an example. Imagine an apartment complex near a hospital. Traditionally, this complex would offer standard units suitable for families and individuals. However, through our solution, the complex would be strategically partitioned, with designated floors reserved for medical professionals. This ensures that doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers have convenient access to housing near their workplace, thereby enhancing their overall well-being and job satisfaction.
